# WeatherApp
In this project I am going to make a request to Weather API , get response and manipulate DOM accordingly

# What I have learnt
#1 sending request to API using fetch
#2 converting the response to JS Object using json() method
#3 using try and catch method to handle the errors
#4 Async and Await keywords how these are used to make js work asynchronously
#5 Updating the DOM using JS
